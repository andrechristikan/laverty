# Vert.x-Proxy - Minimal
Best practice vert.x sync with all futures (without CompletableFuture, i still don't know how to use that).

Futures :
- Controller
- Service and Implement
- Exception
- Route
- Setting from JSON file
- Auth with JWT
- Model
- Promise and Future
- Vert.x-Proxy

Ongoing :
- Creating user model
- Creating authorization login

VERT.X IS NOT A FRAMEWORK, THIS IS JUST A TOOL.
