# Vert.x-Proxy - Minimal
Best practice vert.x sync with all futures (without CompletableFuture, i still don't know how to use that).

*Futures :*
- Controller
- Service and Implement
- Exception
- Route
- Setting from JSON file
- Auth with JWT
- Model
- Promise and Future
- Vert.x-Proxy


*Ongoing :*
- Creating user model
- Creating authorization login
- Rule in request api

*User*
1. username : admin, password : 123456
2. username : user, password : 123456

*Model*
1. If select use SQLConnection
2. If delete inset and update use Transaction

####VERT.X IS NOT A FRAMEWORK, THIS IS JUST A TOOL.
